      description: |
        This endpoint will set up an SSH user for port 1567, so that an rsync
        request (to any directory) will sync files to the new build. The SSH
        username is the `secret` property returned here. If `old-id` is given,
        Slurp will contact Hoarder on the same system, retrieve the
        corresponding archive file, and extract it before the sync takes place,
        allowing for updates to be synced more quickly.
